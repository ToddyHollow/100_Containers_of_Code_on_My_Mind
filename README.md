# 100_Containers_of_Code


One hundred containers of code is not a goal.. it was just a name that came to mind from the old beer song... 100 bottles of beer on the wall, take one down, pass it around, 99 bottles of beer on the wall... 

And the concept was apt.  For me coding is relaxing when I let it be... I do a little and argue with my computer until we are on the same page. Then I learn something, and with frontend, I get to see it grow on my screen...

Eventually, we, some friends and I, are going all link here together so everyone has "Bottles of Beer" and we can share ideas and borrow them and try to improve them (secretly -- less pressure)... 

i.e.  "pass it around" ... 

then there will be 99 Containers of Code on my Mind.
